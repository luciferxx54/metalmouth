# Welcome to Project metalmouth #

[Voice browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_browser) are one type of assistive technology for people with visual disabilities. They typically speak out-loud the content on the screen and allow a user to interact with it via voice commands or input from the keyboard.

## Overview ##

The aim of Project metalmouth is to develop a free fully functioned open source voice browser as an extension for Chrome, to give Chrome users the best possible experience when interacting with a spoken web - by voice commands (using the new HTML5 Speech API) or using the keyboard.

The marvellous folks at Google have continued to improve their Chrome based text-to-speech engine [chrome.tts](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/tts.html) - which is now fully integrated.

The Project metalmouth app accesses the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page being viewed directly so there is no reliance upon Accessibility APIs (IAccessible, IAccessible2, AT-SPI, etc...), or updates to these APIs.  This means that support for new HTML5 element types, or WAI-ARIA defined items, within the app can happen very quickly - in line with demand.

A flexible off-screen model has been incorporated, which is designed to work best with web content developed in accordance with relevant aspects of accessibility standards (first and foremost the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

## Easy Download ##

The Project metalmouth app can be downloaded from the [Project metalmouth app page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bmogbhmnbehfapbmjlaoflagfobahfli) on [Google's Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore), with the benefits of easy and automatic updates!  Over 4000 users agree!

If you want to downloaded and install the packed or unpacked app instead please see the GettingStarted wiki.

## What's coming - 2014 ##

We now have the opportunity to upgrade the metalmouth extension!

In order to ensure that any upgrade is in line with what our current users use, need or don't need we need to ask for their feedback.  We need to spread the word about metalmouth...

We're are going to add support for a larger range of HTML5 elements!

## Getting involved ##

Otherwise, if you are interested in the project or want to get involved there is an official project blog - [http://projectmetalmouth.blogspot.com/](http://projectmetalmouth.blogspot.com/).  This blog tracks the direction of work on this project and is intended as the easiest entry for anyone wishing to take part in the project.

Finally, if you are using the extension or just like the intensions behind the project (I already like you and think your wonderful) I would ask you to get involved in the project (especially user testing, feature requests, etc...) - otherwise, maybe just providing a link to the project website (http://code.google.com/p/metalmouth/) so that others may more easily find it.

The metalmouth extension, and 'metalmouth-speakcr' upgrade, is released under an Apache 2.0 License - this is in order to clarify Project metalmouth's position with regard to accepting patches and contributions, hopefully making it as easy as possible!
