# Project metalmouth extension user guide #

This short guide is intended to assist first time users of the Project metalmouth extension.  It is incomplete and will be added to over time.

## Recommendation: Use a headset ##

It is strongly recommended to use a headset (headphones + microphone), both with regard to information security and when giving voice commands as the sensitivity of the voice input area means it's accuracy is negatively affected by ambient noise.

## Starting the extension ##

Upon installation the metalmouth extension is automatically off.  To use the extension it must be turned on. Two methods exist for turning on the extension, the omnibox method and button method.  In addition, once the metalmouth extension is turned on, a new option "always-on" is available for permanently keeping it on.

### Omnibox Method ###

It is assumed that the Chrome browser has just been started and that the home page or new tab page is being displayed - so the browser's omnibox/url area has focus.  You can also focus the omnibar at any time using the relevant Chrome Shortcut: Windows / Linux: Ctrl+L or Mac: ⌘-L.

  1. To turn on the extension:  When the omnibar has focus, press the m key twice, then the space bar once, type 'on' and finally hit the return key.  (The keyword 'mm' activates the extension). The Project metalmouth extension will turn on - saying "metalmouth extension on". Please read "Extension on" below.

  1. To turn off the extension:  When the omnibar has focus, press the m key twice, then the space bar once, type 'off' and finally hit the return key. The Project metalmouth extension will turn off - saying "metalmouth extension off".

### Extension Button Method ###

  1. Click on the Project metalmouth button (made from the Project metalmouth logo - with mouth closed) in the Chrome browser's toolbar (fig 1).

The Project metalmouth extension will turn on - saying "metalmouth extension on". Please read "Extension on" below.

### If always-on option selected ###

As mentioned an new option is available to permanently keep the metalmouth extension turned on - called "always-on".  If this option is selected the omnibox and button start methods, of course, no longer function.  This option can be turned on or off at any time via the options page (covered later).

## Extension on ##

As soon as the metalmouth extension is turned on the metalmouth icon, visible in the Chrome Browser tool bar (fig 1), changes from having a closed mouth (fig 2) to having an open mouth (fig 3).

## Support for Chrome tabs ##

The metalmouth extension allows for multi-tab voice browsing.  You are free to use Chrome's own shortcuts for opening new tabs and closing existing tabs.  Changing the url of a tab will be covered later.  In case you don't yet know Chrome's shortcuts, please find below a mini-guide.

  1. Focusing the omnibar (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+L or Mac: ⌘-L).
  1. Create a new tab (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+T or Mac: ⌘-T).
  1. Close the current (selected) tab (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+W or Mac: ⌘-W).
  1. Cycle from the current (selected) tab to another tab (Windows / Linux: Ctrl+Tab or Mac: Ctrl-Tab).

## Extension Control - Keyboard ##

To open metalmouth's top menu simply press the tab key.  The top menu bar will then appear at the top of the current tab, just under Chrome browser's own controls (fig 4).

Fig 4.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectmetalmouth/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-12%20at%2016.59.41.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectmetalmouth/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-12%20at%2016.59.41.png)

The control panel contain three buttons - the Change location button, Options button and Close menu button.  The Change location button has focus when the top menu bar is opened.

Pressing enter when the Change location button is focused will cause a sub-menu to be shown. Alternatively, pressing enter when the Options button is focused will open the metalmouth extension options page to open in a new tab.

To close the top menu bar either arrow down to, and click, the close menu button or press ESC.


---


### Change location menu ###

The change location sub-menu (fig 5) contains three options a user can arrow through - visit the previous url from the current tab, change the location of current tab or open a url in a new tab to be opened.

Fig 5.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2009.37.00.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2009.37.00.png)

#### Previous url ####

By pressing enter when the Previous url button is focused the current tab will be directed to the previous url.  Once the page has loaded the metalmouth extension will, as usual, start to read all items.

#### Change url ####

Pressing enter when the Change url button is focused opens the 'Change url entry area' (fig 6), with the text box in this area gaining focus.

Fig 6.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2010.05.50.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2010.05.50.png)

A user can enter a url (which must include the http://, https://, etc...) into this text box.  The Project metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed.

When a url has been entered a user can use the down arrow to focus the Go button.  By pressing enter when the Go button is focused the url location of the current tab will be updated to the newly inputted url.  Once the page has loaded the metalmouth extension will, as usual, start to read all items.

#### New tab ####

Pressing enter when the New tab button is focused opens the 'New tab url entry area' (fig 7), with the text box in this area gaining focus.

Fig 7.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2010.05.50.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2010.05.50.png)

The process for entering a url is exactly the same as for changing a url, only this time a new tab will be created when the 'Go' button is focused and pressed.


---


### Options ###

The options page features all metalmouth options which can be customised - currently:

  * New tab page option
  * Speech rate option
  * Always-on option
  * Voice input option (experimental)

Each of these options is covered in more detail below.

To save the values you have set click the save and close button (bottom of the page) - this will take you back to the page you were looking at prior to selecting options.

#### New tab page option ####

When a new tab is opened the metalmouth extension will automatically update its contents to show "Google's Accessible Search" page.  If another url is desired by the user they simply need to enter the url into the text box input provided next to this option.

#### Speech rate option ####

On Windows / Chrome the speech rate for Chrome's Text-To-Speech engine can be adjusted using the provided range input - selecting a low value will make metalmouth read out content more slowly.

On Macs an [known issue](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=99116) with Chromium / Chrome Text-To-Speech engine has caused unexpected crashes to Chrome, so another Text-To-Speech engine is being used instead.  Sadly this other Text-To-Speech engine does not have a changeable rate option - so on a Mac this option has been temporarily been disabled.

#### Always-on option ####

This new option allows a user to select, via a checkbox, to keep the metalmouth extension permanently turned on. If this option is selected the omnibox and button start methods, of course, no longer function.

#### Voice input option (experimental) ####

On the options page a collection of items marked 'Experimental Features' can be found - containing the 'turn on voice input' option.  As voice input for Project metalmouth is experimental the user needs to select to turn it on before they can use it.

Select the 'turn on voice input' option if you want to try controlling the Project metalmouth extension using voice commands - remembering to save and close the options page using the 'save & close' button.

### In-Tab Navigation mode - simple is best ###

You automatically start off in "navigation mode".  In this mode a simple in-page navigation mechanism is provided (detailed directly below) which allows movement between items in the off-screen model - details of all items (including interactable items) are provided in the "Off-screen model" section in the Appendix at the bottom of the page.

You will only leave 'navigation mode' when you are navigating within a metalmouth menu or interaction area - in which case the in-page navigation mechanism will be suspended.

#### Up/down arrow ####

A user is able to use the up and down arrows at any time (even when the extension is reading) to navigate between items within a page.

In sub menus, you can use the up and down arrows to move between items.  Whilst in a sub menu, a user can hold down the ESC key to bring focus to the "close menu" button.

#### Space bar ####

A user can start/resume reading all items from their current position at any time by hitting the space bar.
The extension can be stopped from reading at any time by hitting the space bar again.

#### Enter ####

If the current item is interactable (the "interactable" keyword will be read out) a user simply needs to hit enter to start interacting.  Interaction is achieved via interaction areas - customised for the specific needs of the action being under taken i.e. inputting text, controlling a video, etc... For details on each of the interaction areas see the Interaction areas section below.

#### Left arrow ####

A user is able to use the left arrow to be taken back to the start of the page.

#### Right arrow ####

A user is able to use the right arrow to cycle through headers in turn.  The first header will be read again after the last header has been read.


---


### Interaction areas ###

As mentioned, user interaction is achieved via interaction areas - customised for the specific needs of the action being under taken i.e. inputting text, controlling a video, etc..

All interaction areas can be closed without a resulting action, either by using the down arrow to focus the Close menu button and pressing enter, or by simply pressing ESC.

#### Text input entry area (also: password, search, email, url, telephone, datetime, date, month, week, time, number) ####

Pressing enter when a text entry related interactable item is focused opens the relevant 'text input entry area' (fig 8), with the text box in this area gaining focus.

Fig 8.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.25.00.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.25.00.png)

A user can enter text into this text box.  The metalmouth extension will say each letter as it is entered into the text box, and will say the letter plus "removed" if the letter has been removed.

When the user is satisfied with the text value they can use the down arrow to focus the Enter button.  Clicking the Enter button will set the associated text value of the element being viewed to the chosen text value. The interaction area will then close, and the user will be returned to 'navigation mode'.

#### Range input entry area ####

Pressing enter when a range input related interactable item is focused opens the 'range input entry area' (fig 9), with the increase value button in this area gaining focus.  In addition, a decrease button, enter button and close menu button are available.

Fig 9.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.28.04.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.28.04.png)

A user uses the relevant arrow buttons to select to focus the increase button or decrease button.  Pressing enter when the increase button is focused will result in the value to be input being increased by one step.  Pressing enter when the decrease button is focused has the opposite effect.  These buttons can be pressed multiple times, until the desired value is obtained or the value min/max limits have been reached.

When the user is satisfied with the value they wish to enter, they should use the relevant arrow key to focus the Enter button and press enter.  This will set the associated value of the element being viewed to the chosen value.  The interaction area will then close, and the user will be returned to 'navigation mode'.

#### Check input entry area (checkbox and radio button) ####

Pressing enter when a check input related interactable item is focused opens the 'check input entry area' (fig 10), with the check button in this area gaining focus.  In addition, an uncheck button and close menu button are available.

Fig 10.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.30.36.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.30.36.png)

A user uses the relevant arrow buttons to select to focus the check button or uncheck button.  Pressing enter when the check button is focused will result in a check in the associated element being viewed - uncheck has the opposite effect.  In both cases, the interaction area will then close, and the user will be returned to 'navigation mode'.

#### Single select entry area ####

Pressing enter when a single select menu related interactable item is focused opens the 'single select input entry area' (fig 11), with the Next option button in this area gaining focus.  In addition, a Previous button, Select button and Close menu button are available.

Fig 11.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.33.33.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.33.33.png)

The user can use the relevant arrow buttons to select to focus the Next option button or Previous option  button, if the initial option is unwanted.  Pressing enter when the Next option button is focused will result in the next available option being read out.  Pressing enter when the Previous option button is focused has the opposite effect.

When the user is satisfied with the option they wish to enter, they should use the relevant arrow key to focus the Enter button and press enter.  This will set the associated value of the element being viewed to the chosen option.  The interaction area will then close, and the user will be returned to 'navigation mode'.

#### Multi select entry area ####

Pressing enter when a multi select menu related interactable item is focused opens the 'multi select input entry area' (fig 12), with the Next option button in this area gaining focus.  In addition, a Previous button, Select button, Check button, Uncheck button and Close menu button are available.

Fig 12.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.35.20.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.35.20.png)

The user can use the relevant arrow buttons to select to focus the Next option button or Previous option  button, if the initial option is unwanted.  Pressing enter when the Next option button is focused will result in the next available option being read out.  Pressing enter when the Previous option button is focused has the opposite effect.

When the user is satisfied with an option they wish to select, they should use the relevant arrow key to focus the Check button and press enter.  This will mark the current option as selected. They can choose to unselect a selected option by focusing the Uncheck button and pressing enter. When all required options have been selected (and marked as such) the user should use the relevant arrow buttons to focus the Enter button and press enter.  This will set the associated values of the element being viewed to the chosen options.  The interaction area will then close, and the user will be returned to 'navigation mode'.

#### HTML5 Audio control ####

Pressing enter when an HTML5 audio related interactable item is focused opens the 'audio interaction area' (fig 13), with the Play button in this area gaining focus.  In addition, a Pause button, Rewind button and Close menu button are available.

Fig 13.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.38.25.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.38.25.png)

The user should select to close the menu after they have finished interacting with the audio content.

#### HTML5 Video control ####

Pressing enter when an HTML5 video related interactable item is focused opens the 'video interaction area' (fig 14), with the Play button in this area gaining focus.  In addition, a Pause button, Rewind button and Close menu button are available.

Fig 14.

## Extension Control - Experimental Voice Commands ##

### Limitations ###

The [HTML5 Speech Input API](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0020/api-draft.html), Google's implementation of which the Project metalmouth extension utilises for speech input, is still under development.  It is for this reason that the voice input function is marked as experimental - requiring the user to turn it on in Project metalmouth's options.

Several issues currently exist which degrade the usefulness of this API for people with visual disabilities - see [webkitSpeechAPIComments](webkitSpeechAPIComments.md).

Limitations aside, it is without doubt that voice input will be increasingly important in the future for all users - especially those with disabilities.  It is hoped that Project metalmouth's early implementation of the webkit-speech API's will allow feedback to be provided to its developers ([HTML5 Speech Input API](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0020/api-draft.html)) regarding possible issues affecting people with visual disabilities.

### Using voice commands ###

After the option to 'turn on voice input' has been selected and the options page has been saved the user will be returned to the previous tab they where in.  Voice command input should not be activated.

To use voice input right click on the mouse - the voice input box will automatically be centred under the mouse cursor (wherever the mouse is on the page).  If you are unsure if the cursor might have moved simply right click again, and the voice input box will re-centre.

Fig 15.

![https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.44.00.png](https://sites.google.com/site/projectaccessami/home/Screen%20shot%202012-01-13%20at%2011.44.00.png)

Now using the left mouse button to click - it will automatically be on the microphone if you made a right click first. After metalmouth has said 'speak now', speak the voice command (see Voice Commands).

As mentioned earlier, there are still several limitations for a person with a visual disability to use this voice input - visit [webkitSpeechAPIComments](webkitSpeechAPIComments.md) and see if you can add more...  Also, it is important to reemphasis the importance of using a headset (headphones + microphone).

If voice input cannot hear what has been said after 10 secs a warning will be given - click once on the left mouse button, and try to enter the voice command again by clicking the left mouse button again.

### Voice commands ###

Saying the following single words will execute the following commands:

  * 'all' - Reads out all items;
  * 'next' - Reads out the next item;
  * ''previous' - Reads out the previous item;
  * 'do' - Interact with the current item;
  * 'stop' - Stop reading out all items.
  * 'continue' - Continue to read out all items from the current position;
  * 'jump' - Jump to the next heading;
  * 'options' - Opens the options page;
  * 'location' - Opens the navigation sub-menu.

More and more use of the Speech Input API is planned, along with a change to the control panel which will aid both voice and keyboard users...

## Appendix ##

### Off-screen model ###

Project metalmouth's off-screen model comprises of both static and interactable items which reflect the state of the current GUI objects displayed on the screen.

Static items allow web content to be repackaged into more cohesive blocks of semantic information - so that it can be better understood by vision impaired users. Interactable items allow the way in which a user interacts with an HTML object to be changed to improve user experience.

The off-screen model developed for Project metalmouth has been designed to work best with web content developed in accordance with relevant aspects of accessibility standards (first and foremost the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

If the (X)HTML code from which they are formed is present, the following 'off-screen model' objects can be navigated to:

  * page header area;
  * site navigation area;
  * menu;
  * menu item;
  * main content area;
  * page footer area;
  * page contact details;
  * skip link;
  * skip target;
  * link;
  * text box;
  * search box;
  * password box;
  * button;
  * check button;
  * single select (drop-down menu with one selectable option);
  * static text;
  * level 1 - 6 headers;
  * section;
  * paragraph;
  * sentence;
  * quote;
  * quote link;
  * insertion;
  * deletion;
  * code;
  * form;
  * input group;
  * telephone box;
  * url box;
  * email box;
  * number box;
  * datetime box;
  * date box;
  * month box;
  * week box;
  * time box;
  * range input;
  * bulleted list;
  * numbered list;
  * list item;
  * map;
  * map area;
  * data table;
  * header cell;
  * data cell;
  * audio;
  * video;
  * canvas;
  * semantic image.

Some of these items can also be interacted with:

  * **skip link**: Interaction will move the user to the identified skip target.
  * **link**: Interaction will direct the Chrome browser to the new location and reload the Project metalmouth extension.
  * **quote link**: Interaction same as link.
  * **map area**: Interaction same as link.
  * **text box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **search box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **password box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **telephone box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **url box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **e-mail box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **number box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **datetime box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **date box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **month box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **week box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **time box**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **button**: Interaction will click the live button corresponding to the 'off-screen model' object which was read out.
  * **check button**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **single select**:See Interaction area section above.
  * **multi select**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **range input**: See Interaction area section above.
  * **audio**: See Interaction area section above.
