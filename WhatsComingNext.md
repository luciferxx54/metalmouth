The big question on the agenda is "what baseline level of support for HTML5 items is needed in order to consider Project metalmouth a useful assistive technology for web content?"

With an even bigger question to follow - "does such a baseline already exist, and if not would it be something other web content orientated screen-readers / voice browsers would be interested to explore / sign up to?"

In the meantime, the list of items on the to do list looks like this:

## 1) Support for additional HTML5 elements ##

## 2) Support for multi-select boxes and data lists ##

## 3) Iframes ##

## 4) Support for input type=file ##

If the url for a local file server has been provided metalmouth will be able to override the native file call and open a window showing the local file server contents.

Any other ideas would be welcome?
